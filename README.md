# PCRE2.py: Python bindings for the PCRE2 regular expression library

:construction: **This project is currently under active development and still in planning stages.**  :construction:

This project contains Python bindings for [PCRE2](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2) with a similar API to Python's built-in [re module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).

## Perl compatible regular expressions

PCRE2 is the revised API for the Perl-compatible regular expressions, or PCRE, library created by Philip Hazel.
For source code, see the [official PCRE2 repository](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2).
The [PCRE2 license](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/blob/master/LICENCE) is reproduced in the license provided by this project.

## Installation

If a wheel is not available for your platform, the source for PCRE2 is downloaded over HTTP from the [PCRE2 releases](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/releases/) and built. Building requires:

* `autoconf`
* C compiler toolchain, such as `gcc` and `make`
* `libtool`
* Python headers
